-- This is a little more advanced, so don't worry
-- if you don't understand it right now! :)

-- arg is an "argument", it's an extra string
-- passed to the program.
-- when you type "hello joe", "joe" is the argument

local arg = { ... }

-- We need to check if the user gave us an argument
-- If they did, we say Howdy!

if arg[1] then
  print("Howdy "..arg[1].."!")
else

-- If they didn't we give them an error message.
  print("Please enter a name. example: hello joe")
end
